 
what's network : group of devices connected together to share resources 
any service on the internet called web based -> like web based compiler , web based email , and so on  
<< network components >>

- computers(end devices) : devices that can send and receives data like pc, tablets, smart phones, labtop , embeded system in machine(IOT)
- computer peripherals   : any device can connect to PC like printer , scanner
- connecting devices     : like router and switch and access points help to send data from sender to reveiver
- transmission medium    : if data transfer via cables [wired media] , wireless media  
			   
cable(wired) media: 
- twisted piar cable: 
  1. UTP [unshielded twisted pair], 
     Most common,
     Easy to install,
     Less expensive ,
     Effected By electromagnetic interference 
     Use RJ-45 connectors
  
  2. STP [shielded twisted pair],
     Hard to install
     Use RJ-45 connectors
     
  3. Coaxial cable
     High capacity cable
     Used for video transfer
     Use BNC connector

– Fiber Optic Cables	
  The core that carries the signals. It is made of plastic or glass
  Fiber Optic Types
	- Single Mode 
	- Multi-Mode       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< network topologies >>
 - the organizational way of interconnected nodes of computer network. 
 - there is Different network topologies
	- point to point topology : the sender and receiver only with transmission media
	- bus topology  : Each computer connects to a common cable via connertors,
			  The ends of the cable have a terminator installed to prevent signal reflections
	- Ring topology : computer are connected in a physical ring or circle.
	- Star topology : It has a central connection point [ hub, switch, or router] . the most common
	- mesh topology : each node has direct cable to each another node on the networks
 
<< computer network categories >>
- transmission mode
	simplex     : all the time device is the sender and device is the receiver  [direction of data:  sender -> receiver ]
	half duplex : at some instance of time only one device can send data
		      [direction of data:  sender ---> receiver] or [direction of data:  receiver <--- sender ]
	full duplex : device can be sender and receiver at the same time  [direction of data:  receiver <---> sender ]

- geographical area: LAN (local area network), WAN (wide area network)

- adminstration(model) type: 
	peer to peer network: all devices have same abilities , no central server , devices used client operating system like windows 10
			      allowing two or more computer systems to connect and share resources
                              each device on the network can be a server or a client.
	
 	client server network: client machines conntect to central server , server opering system 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- device communicates on a network : means device can send and receive data

NIC (network interface card) : device can't communicate on a network without NIC , link between computer and computer network , 

hub : - have only one collision domain , which means the devices connected to a hub are in a single collision domain 
      - in a situation where two devices send out their messages simultaneously, a collision will occur, This can cause traffic problems.
      - have only one broadcast domain
      - half duplex

switch: - each port of a switch is in one collision domain.
	- which means the number of collision domains for a switch is related with the switch ports number 
	- but there is still a problem with switches, there is only a single broadcast domain in the switch.
	  which means it is not a broadcast domain separator so If a device sends a broadcast message, it will still cause congestion.
	- work on data link layer
	- connect devices on the same network

router: - each port is in one collosion domain like switch ,ecah port is in one broadcast domain 
      : - used to pass data between one or more local area networks (LANs)
	- connect between networks
	- port also called -> ethernet port	
	- work on network layer

access point: - device that provide connection between Peripheral devices
              - on one hand it connects wireless by its antenna 
	      - on second hand it connects with infrustructure of the place by using RG-45 connector
	      - one collision domain : solved by csma/ca (carrier sense multiple access/ collision avoidance) technology that allow
				       device to send RTS (request to send) and waiting  CTS (clear to send) to send the data
	      - one broadcast domain  
	      - can hold more than SSID (service set identifier)
	      - access point security: - hidden SSID
				       - filtering the devices that allowed to use my network using MAC address , IP address
		                       - encryption  data on access point using encryption algorithms like AES  

Repeater: Regenerate the signal over the same network before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<< websites  info >>

Collision domain:  is a single physical line that a collision can occur. In other words, it is a network domain that allows only 
	           one device to transfer data at a time. If one more device tries to send data at the same time in a collision domain,
	 	   collision occurs. This means that there will be data loss
 
broadcast domain: In networking, a broadcast means that we send something that everyone receives, whether they need/want it or not
		  
Network congestion refers to a reduction in quality of service (QOS) that causes packet loss, queueing delay

Bandwidth:  is the amount of data that can be transmitted within a fixed time period.
Latency  :  is the amount of time it takes data to travel from source to destination.
	   

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< how data is sent from device to another although data type can be text, video , audio , etc... >>

- protocol : rules must be approved by sender and receiver

- yesterday every company created protocol for communication , ISO in 1983 make reference model for communication

- OSI organization make standards for sending data (communication) called  OSI Model -> open system interconnection model

OSI/RM : Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model


7. application layer
	- the layer that interact with the user , the link between user and other 6 layers
	- Interface to end users
	- responsible for making communication between applications (application layer) on others computers
	- specify the suitable protocol according to user request like https,http,DNS, FTP, telnet
	- provides Many services like: File transfer , Network management , Email 

6. Presentation layer
	- Finding common presentation between source and Destination
	- it responsible for making format for data using encryption and compression that can be transmitted over the internet
	- encrption and compression -> during sending data
	- decryption and decompression-> during receving data

5. Session layer
	- establish connection(communication sessions) between sender and receiver
	- This layer allows users on different machines to communicate
	- synchronization opertion done by session layer , means adding checkpoints into stream of data -> ALAA ELDIN GAME [checkpoint]
	- it terminates the session after data is sent from sender to receiver

4. Transport layer
	- divide Organize) data into segements 
	- each segement attached with a sequence number and check sum
	- End-to-end error recovery , End-to-end flow control
        - Provide reliable transport between sender and receiver
	- when receving data it makes reassembly opertion using the segment sequence
	- connection oriented : ensure that there is a connection between sender and receiver before sending data 
	- connectionless oriented (best effort delivery) : sending data without ensure that there is a connection between sender and receiver
	- flow control : control the speed of sending and receiving frames between sender and receiver
	- Session multiplexing:
	- source and destination ports are added  

3. Network layer 
	- receiving data in the form of segements and converting it ito packets by adding header 
	- this header contains the source IP address and destination IP Adress [addressing]
	- routing operation is done [when device trying to communicate with device on other network network]
	- It know the best path for the destination (Routing)
	- it deals with router

2. Data link layer
	- consist of 2 parts 
	- the first called logical link contol (LLC) that responsible for converting data into frames ,
	  
	- second part : MAC (media access control ) that add to each frame sender and receiver unique physical address (mac address),
	  connected with physical layer
	- ensure that frames without errors and complete by adding FCS (frame check sequence ) to each frame
	- Hop to hop addressing
	- Error notification(detection) : detects damaged or lost frames
	- communication on data link layer 
		unicast   : message from device to device
		broadcast : message to all devices
		multicast : message to group of devices existed externally


1. Physical layer : 
	- responsible for converting data into bits and send it
	- responsible for placing data on transmission media whether it wired or wireless
	  data is converted to bits then into Electrical form -> with copper
  	  data is converted to bits then into ligh form -> with fiber optic cable
	  data is converted to bits then Electromagnetism form -> wireless transmission
	  

- OSI model not used now -> the used is tcp/ip protocol 
TCP/IP : Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
4. application 
3. transport
2. internet
1. link


1. application layer protocols: Communication between processes or applications
		                specify the suitable protocol according to user request like : 
	                        HTTP, DNS, FTP, TELNET, SSH, RDP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP4
	
  http protocol : 
	transfer web pages from server to client , 
	transfer info from client to server
	Supports the delivery of web pages to the client

  FTP (file transfer protocol): transfer files between client and server  
  SMTP (simple mail tranfer protocl): send email from client to sender
  POP3 (Post office transfers Protocol) : receives email from server and emails stored at local storage
  IMAP4 : receives email from server and emails are not stored at local storage, user can go to his inbox and control it 
  DNS (domain name system protocol): map(convert) domain name with its IP address
  DHCP (dynamic host configuration protocol): assign ip address to devices on the network
  TELNET : manage device remotely has shortage on security as authenticated data doesn't encypted which means data exspose to sniffing
  SSH    : manage device remotely but it more secure as it encrypt data
  RDP    : Microsoft protocol used to manage windows device remotely 

2. transport layer protocol : 
  TCP [transmission control protocol]: 
	- reliable [ sender will receives acknowledgennt that message is sent without error ] 
	- synchoronization , 
        - connected oreinted,
	- data recovery, using when sending documents, text
	- Use port numbers
	- Full duplex


  UDP protocol : need high speed of it , unreliable , connectionless , using with video streaming, no recovery, Best-effort delivery 

3. network layer protocol
   ICMP : check connectivity betweeb devices using command ping
   ARP  : 
   IP   :  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how many network interface card in your labtop(device) : 3 NIC [wifi , ethernet , bluetooth] which means 3 mac addresses
					       : and if you have virtual machine it will have vitrual mac also 

<< IP ADDRESS >>
- IPv4 it's 32 bits (4bytes) (4 octets)
- IPv6 it's 128 bits
- The loopback address is a special address (usually 127.0.0.1 in IPv4)
- 1 octet represented number from 0 to 255
- it's also known as a logical address
- any device on the network has an unique IP ADDRESS (like house number in street)
- unique number assigned to device to communicate with the network
- operate at nework layer
- IP address can't ends with 0 as it's reserved for network id
- IP address can't ends with 255 as it's reserved for broadcasting

- calss A -> 1.0.0.0    to 126.255.255.255     -> network.host.host.host
- class B -> 128.0.0.0  to 191.255.255.255     -> network.network.host.host
- class C -> 192.0.0.0  to 223.255.255.255     ->  network.network.network.host
- class D -> 224.0.0.0  to 239.255.255.255     -> reserved for multicasting
- class E -> 240.0.0.0  to 254.255.255.255     -> experimental
- note class A addresses from  127.0.0.1 [local host] to 127.255.255.255 is reserved for loobacking testing

- number of ip addresses is not enough for all devices so ICAN oragnization divide ip address to 
  1. public ip addresses  [real IP ]  -> routed which means can communicate with internet ,  
	class A [ public IP range ]   -> 1.0.0.0   to 9.255.255.255
	class B [ public IP range ]   -> 128.0.0.0 to 172.15.255.255   , 172.32.0.0   to 191.255.255.255 
	class C [ public IP range ]   -> 192.0.0.0 to 192.167.255.255  , 192.169.0.0  to 223.255.255.255 
 
  2. private ip addresses [local IP]  -> not routed which means can't communicate with internet
	class A [ private IP range ]  -> 10.0.0.0     to 10.255.255.255 
	class B [ private IP range ]  -> 172.16.0.0   to 172.31.255.255 
	class C [ private IP range ]  -> 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


- Nat is used to Translate the private IP address to public IP addresses.
- ISP [internet service provider] : is a company or organization that provides access to the internet

- router has 2 NIF : internal NIC ( gateway of network devices 192.168.1.1 [local IP address] ) , 
  external NIC with public IP address that allow devices connected on the network to communicate with the internet
  the public IP address that assigned to external NIC is given BY ISP [internet service provider]
	
- DHCP protocol : is a network management protocol used to assign IP addresses to devices connected to the network 
- DHCP service : a service exists on your router that give an IP address to the devices , 
	         and you can limit the devices that take ip address using their mac addresses  

-IP address assigned by 3 ways
  1. manually by assign static ip address for each device => casue conflict in internal network 
 
  2. automatically using DHCP protocol , each ip address has expired time 
     the device send broadcasting message [discover message ] and DHCP server will reply on the message with offer ip address , 
     the device will request for this ip and DHCP server will reply with acknowledgment of using the ip, this operation called dora process 
 
  3. apepa address if there is no ip address assigned to device , operating system will do this mission and assign rondom ip address for the 
     device and network devices can communicate internally only (not routed), but it's possible that 2 devices has the same ip address as 
     it assigned rondomly and this lead to conflict
     apepa IP address always start with -> 169.254.X.X
 
- if you have a server that povide a service on the internet you have better to assign static ip address to this server why 
   in case of problem occur to DHCP service don't affect on the service

ipconfig/release    -> device will be without ip address
ipconfig/renew      -> renew the period of expired time of IP address
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< mac address >>

mac address : called also physical address
	    : stands for Media Access Control address
	    : static and burned in NIC
	    : 6 bytes -> first 3 bytes for organization unique identifier , second 3 bytes for the NIC (device identifier) 
	    : used for local network communication
	    : operates at data-link layer

<< how the device know the mac address of the destination >>
	- destination ip you have by its owner  
	- at first source device make the destination of mac address broadcast as it didn't know the mac address of destination
	- message is sent to switch and switch store the mac-address in its table if not exist 
	- message is sent by switch to all devices on the network , data link layer of at each device check the ip-address attached with message 
	- the device with the same ip-address will respond to the message and switch will store the mac-address of this device in its table if not exist 
	- once device communicate with another device, it will store the mac address of this device at arp-table to get it faster
	  rather than using the broadcast that make the network delay , arp table [ip-address , mac address]
		 
	- switch has mac-address table [switch_port, mac address]


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<< DNS protocol >>

- application layer protptcol
- DNS protocol (domain name server ):

- senario is client at first check at its cashing to find the IP address of domain name , if not exist ,
  client search on hosts file existed locally on C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc [that was used before DNS] if not exist ,
  client search at dns service that assigned by DHCP that has a table that map each domain name with its ip address
	
  briefly: try to find the ip address of domain name at cashing then hosts file then client search at 
	   dns service that assigned by DHCP that has a table that map each domain name with its ip address

- it's better for DNS service to be provided by google DNS server [which is 8.8.8.8 and it's assigned automatically in your router]
- port : 53

command   -> ipconfig/displaydns -> display the cashed domain names with its ip addresses on the device cashaing
nslookup  -> to query on dns [lets you to enter a host name and find out the corresponding IP address]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< ftp protocol >>
- file transfer protocol
- responosible for download and upload the file [transfering files between server and receiver]
- to make the device ftp server
	- set up ftp server on pc ->  by set up software like fileZella server
	- create home directory
	- configure the user by making username and password to the user who can access our home directory
	- set permission for the user [read(download files) , write (upload files)]
- to connect to ftp server
	1. using url     --> write at browser: ftp://ip_address_of_ftp_server then pop up menu will ask you for user name and password
	2. using command -->
	   - to connect with the destination ftp device using cmd first make the cmd cursor on c:\ by enter cd.. , then write ftp 
  	    then ->  open ip_address_of_ftp_server
	   - to display the shared files using command -> ls
	   - to display the shared files and permissions using command -> dir
	   - to get(download) file from the shared directory -> get file_name.extension
	   - to display the directory of the downloaded file -> lcd
	   - to uoload file to the shared directory ->  put file_name.extension
	   - to end the session -> close 
  	   - to go out from ftp -> bye
	
	3. software tool [most commomly used] like fileZella client


- uses both TCP and UFP
- (FTP) : Port 21 for command and control,
- (FTP) :Port 20 for data transport .

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<< TELNET , SHH , RDP >>

- protocols used to manage device remotely

- telnet : has shortage on security as authenticated data sends in the form of clear text [doesn't encypted]
- SSH    : manage device remotely but it more secure as it encrypt data
- RDP    : Microsoft protocol used to manage windows device remotely 

how to make a device accepts to be managed remotely
	- enable remote desktop protocol
	- authentication 
	- set permission


- to create user on your device that you want it mangage remotely -> pc -> right click -> manage -> local users and groups ->
  users -> right click on window -> new user ->  create user ITI as example -> select user ITI -> right click -> properties ->
  enter member of tab -> add -> advanced -> find now -> select remote desktop users

- to allow remote access for a user -> go to control panel -> system and security -> allow remote access ->
   allow remote connection to this computer -> select user -> select ahmed

- how can i connect to device remtoly 
  on search -> write remote desktop connection -> enter ip of device you want to control it -> enter user and password
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< ports >>

  - there are 65,535 ports on NIC device
  - ports : منافذ لدخول وخروج الداتا

  - port allows client device to enter the destination device , and use the service published on the port
  - Each port is associated with a specific process or service , each service published on the server can be accessed by specific port
  - Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic: emails go to a different port than webpages
  - Most ports are reserved for certain protocols for example, all HTTP messages(request) go to port 80
  - ports of source and destination are specified in tcp header

port categorized into 3 category :
1. well known ports  from 1 to 1023 assigned and controlled by ICANN
2. registered ports  from 1024 to 49151  
3. dynamic ports   from 49152 to 65535

- ((FTP)) : Port 21 for command and control,
- (FTP)   : Port 20 for data transport .
- TFTP : 69
- HTTP : 80
- HTTPS: 443
- TELNET: 23
- SHH : 22
- DNS : 53
- POP : 110
- smtp 25
- imap: 143
- SNMP 161

netstat -n  -> check opened ports on tcp protocol
netstat -a  -> check opened ports on udp protocol

- you can scan the opened ports on devices on network ,  you can use software like lanPortScanner 

- you can block the port using network firewall
- firewall : control the traffic [inbound traffic [from out to in] , outbound traffic]
- firewall is like the rules and the traffic that match the rules will be allowed  

to block a port  : goto firewall-> advanced setting -> select inbound or outbound  -> new rule -> select port -> select tcp or udp  , select port number ->
		  select the action (block connection) ->  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< http protocol >>
- protocol that used in web server
- your browser knows that all web servers that use nonsecure HTTP listen on port 80 , secured uses 443

if you open browser and write : https://www.google.com:80/search    --> url (universal resource locator)
	https, http or ftp -> protocol
	www.google.com     ->  domain name that mapped to IP Adress of the device that website is published on and your device will connect with
			       , device that perform mapping operation is DNS server
	80 : port number -> المنفذ اللى بيدخلنى على الجهاز بتاع ال destination علشان افرق انا عايز انى سيرفيز من السيرفيز اللى موجودة
	80 : to enter the destination device through port 80 and use the service published on it but , port number not written by end user as browser do it
	     automatically	

- the senario: user enter  http://www.google.com -> the DNS server will convert the domain name google.com to its ip address
  the client device will use the ip address to connect to detination and enter to destination through port 80 [ the port that reserved to http request]
  and use the service published on this port

HTTP: 80
HTTPS: 443

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<< mail protocols >>

SMTP (simple mail tranfer protocl):  send email from client to sender
POP3 (post office protocl version3) : receives email from server and emails stored at local storage
				      free up server storage , allow uer to read email offline
				      the risk : losing data if computer crashes
IMAP4 : receives email from server and emails are not stored at local storage he is only see header, user can go to his inbox and control it 

mail adminstrator configure emails for employees by make for each empolyee Qota on the server to receive and send emails from it 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<< network layer >>

- ip routing : sending message from network to network

router has 2 NIF : internal NIC ( gateway of network devices 192.168.1.1 [local IP address] ) , 
  external NIC with public IP address that allow devices connected on the network to communicate with the internet
  the public IP address that assigned to external NIC is given BY ISP [internet service provider]

nating operation : when router replace the source local ip address of packet with its real ip address to communicate with external network 

routing senario : 
  if one of the devices on the network try to communicate with IP address not exist on the network, the router will store source ip address 
  and detination in its translation (routing)table , and replace the local source ip address with its public ip address existed in external NIC [nating] 
  to be allowed to communicated with external network

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<< ICMP protocol >>

- check connectivity between devices using command ping
- ping ip_address  -> check connectivity
- ping ip_address -n 10 -> ping 10 packets
- ping ip_address -t    -> ping unlimited packets , it's stopped by ctrl+c

- ping command used in dos(denial of service) attack 
- NIC has a buffer that receives all requests
- ping ip_address -l 40000 -t -> ping unlimited packets with 40000 bytes // dos attack

- organization is always block outbound traffic of ping
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ipconfig         -> to see the IP address of the device (ipv4) 127.0.0.1 -> let's say 192.168.81.129
ipconfig/release    -> device will be without ip address
ipconfig/renew      -> renew the period of expired time of IP address

getmac/v            -> get all mac addresses on your devices
ipconfig/all     -> To check your physical address

arp -a	            -> display the mac adresses that your devices communicate with

curl ifconfig.me    -> to get the public ip address of the router
ipconfig/displaydns -> display the cashed domain names with its ip addresses
nslookup  -> to query on dns [lets you to enter a host name and find out the corresponding IP address]
netstat -n  -> check opened ports on tcp protocol
netstat -a  -> check opened ports on udp protocol

route print ->

-
