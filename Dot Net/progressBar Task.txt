stream: is a sequence of data that you can read from or write to — kind of like a pipe or a conveyor belt
so you can refer to stream as --> data


📦 Examples of streams:

Stream Type	Description
FileStream	Reads from or writes to a file
MemoryStream	Uses RAM instead of a file
NetworkStream	Sends or receives data over a network
Stream (base)	Abstract base class for all streams





chunk  = buffer

When you're reading or writing large files, you don't read/write the whole file at once — you break it into smaller chunks (called buffers).
