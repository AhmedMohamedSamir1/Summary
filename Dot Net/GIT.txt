<< github in visual studio >>


- it’s generally recommended to commit (or at least stash) your changes before switching branches in Git.


- to delete a specific commit locally in a a specific branch, use reset which has two option
	- reset and keep changes   : delete commit and keep the changes
	- reset and delete changes : delete commit and delete the changes  // think twice before it
	
- to make a new commit that undoes the changes use revert
	- for example: 
	  You made commit abc123 that added a file test.txt.
	  If you revert abc123, Git will create a new commit that removes test.txt,
 	  so the repository looks like the commit never happened.

- when checkout from branch to another and you have uncommited files
