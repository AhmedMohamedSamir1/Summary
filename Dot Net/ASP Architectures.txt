<<<< N-Tier Architecture >>>>


- A physical separation of an application into multiple tiers, where each tier runs(live) on a separate machine or process.
- N-Tier means the system is deployed on multiple physical machines
- keep in mind if all layers are in 1 project run on one server, that is NOT N-Tier it becomes a Layered Architecture
	- There are no network boundaries ( on 1 server:)

- Network boundaries between tiers 
	- means each tier runs(live) on different servers, so the communication between them happens over the network
  	- [ Web Server ]  -- network boundary -->  [ Application Server ]  ---- network -->  [ Database Server ]
	- The database runs on a highly protected server Isolated behind final firewall (put in a private network)


- It is usually made of:
  1- Presentation Tier runs on a public server
  2- (Business Tier) Application Tier runs on an internal server
  3- Infrastructure (Data) Tier runs on a highly protected server


Public Server: Web Server (ASP.NET Core app), API Gateway
	cessible from the internet
	Anyone can send a request to it
	Usually placed in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

Internal Server: Application Server (Business Logic), Microservices, Internal APIs, Background services
	Not exposed to the internet
	Only accessible from inside the company network
	Public servers can call it, but users cannot



when to use
	- Use N-Tier when you want actual physical deployment on multiple servers.
	- N-Tiers is recommended when each part of the system must scale independently.
	- You want to isolate the database behind firewalls
		

Why use N-Tier (Microsoft Reasons)
	- Scalability: You can scale a tier independently (e.g., more web servers).

	- Security: You can isolate DB servers behind firewalls, only business tier can talk to DB.

	- Manageability: Each tier can be maintained and deployed separately.

	- Separation of concerns: Presentation ≠ Business ≠ Data.



-- summary

N-Tier Architecture is a physical separation of an application into multiple tiers Presentation, Business/Application, and Data, each deployed 
on a separate server. This creates network boundaries, allowing scalability, security, and independent manageability.
Public servers (UI) are exposed to the internet, internal servers (business logic) are inside the company network, and protected servers (DB)
are isolated behind firewalls. If all layers are on one server, it is only layered architecture, not N-Tier.”

<< Onion Architecture >>

---- Domain (Core) Layer (Center)
	Entities, business rules, domain logic
	Pure C# classes without references to UI, database, or frameworks
	The heart of your application

---- Domain Services / Application Layer

	Orchestrates workflows
	Defines interfaces for repositories, messaging, etc.
	Depends only on Domain Layer

---- Infrastructure Layer
	- Implements interfaces defined in the Domain/Application layers
	- Database access, file storage, external services
	- Can change without affecting core domain

---- Presentation Layer / UI Layer (Outer Layer)
	- Web, API, desktop apps
	- Calls application services
	- Depends on the inner layers, not vice versa
	
Example:
   - Domain Layer
	- Entities (Order, ETC).
	- Interfaces in the Domain Layer should express pure business , not infrastructure or UI concerns
		public interface IDiscountPolicy { decimal ApplyDiscount(Order order); }  	 // pure business abstractions
		public interface IShippingCalculator { decimal CalculateShipping(Order order); } // pure business abstractions
	- implmentations of pure business interfaces
	- Developers write pure business logic that: uses only entity properties, uses value objects, enforces domain invariants, 
	  has NO database, NO infrastructure, NO external API

   - Application Layer
	- IOrderRepository, IGenericRpository
	- IOrderService
	- OrderService
	- DTOS
	- External Services Interfaces (Payment, Email, SMS, Files)
	- Depends only on Domain Layer
	- 


  - Infrastructure
	- OrderRepository, GenericRepository
	- Infrastructure Layer depends on Application Layer only via interfaces.
	- External systems should be implemented in the infrastructure layer
		- (Payment) PayPalPaymentService
		- (Files) LocalFileStorage, CloudFileStorage
		- (Caching) RedisCacheService, MemoryCacheService
		- (BackgroundJobs) HangfireJobs.cs

  - Presentation Layer / UI
	- Depends on application layer, Calls services like IOrderService
	- refers to Infrastructure for EF purposes

---- summary
   Onion Architecture is a logical architecture with strict dependency rules.
   All layers typically run within the same server, and the Domain is the center that everything depends on.
