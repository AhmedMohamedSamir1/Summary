- MediatR is a popular .NET library that helps you implement the Mediator design pattern
  It allows components to communicate indirectly through a mediator instead of calling each other directly.



Instead of:
	controller -> service -> repository
You do:
	controller -> MediatR -> handler -> repository
	Controller -> MediatR (Command)  -> Handler -> Service -> Repository ->  Database
🎯 Why Use MediatR?
	- Decouples code — Controllers don’t directly depend on services.
	- Organizes business logic — Each action (e.g., CreateOrder, GetUserById) has its own handler.
	- Works well with CQRS, Clean Architecture, and Onion Architecture.

- 🧱 Core Concepts of MediatR
	- IRequest<T>: 				--> Represents a command or query with a response
	- IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>	--> Handles the request
	- IMediator				--> The mediator service to send requests


- ✨ Real-life Analogy
	- Imagine you're in a restaurant:
		- You (controller) want food (data).
		- Instead of going to the kitchen (handler) yourself, you ask a waiter (mediator).
		- The waiter takes your request to the kitchen and returns the result.
		- You and the kitchen are decoupled.
