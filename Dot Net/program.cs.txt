- It typically contains the entry point for the application and defines the application's configuration, services, middleware, and overall startup logic.

- The Program.cs file contains the Main method, which is the entry point of the application
	- It is responsible for bootstrapping (start) the application and calling the Host to start the app
		- Bootstrapping refers to the process of initializing or starting up an application. In software development, it typically means setting up the necessary
		  infrastructure or environment before the actual application code runs. It’s like getting everything ready(loading configuration, setting up services,etc)
		  so that the main logic of your application can operate properly.

	- Host is the engine that runs your application r,

- var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
	1- initializes a new instance of the WebApplicationBuilder class, which is used to configure the web application
	
	2- The builder sets up default configuration from multiple sources like:
		- appsettings.json (your application's primary settings file).
		- appsettings.{Environment}.json (environment-specific settings, e.g., for Development, Production).
		- Environment variables (useful for containerized environments like Docker).
		- Command-line arguments (passed in args from the terminal or when deploying to a server).
			- The args parameter allows command-line arguments to be passed to the application at startup, 
                          which can be used to override configuration settings dynamically.
	
	3- creates and configures the host (a runtime environment that manages the application's lifecycle).
		- Host configuration includes things like
			- The web server to use (e.g., Kestrel or IIS).
			- The environment the app is running in (e.g., Development, Production, Staging).
				- The builder.Environment object provides information about the environment (e.g., Development, Production) the app is running in.
				- depending on the environment settings. You can set up different behaviors
			- How logging is configured.
	
	4 - initializes the dependency injection container, where you can register services your application depends on.
	
	- After CreateBuilder – Next Steps
		- Register Services
		- Building the app with builder.Build(), which compiles the configurations.
		- Defining the middleware pipeline methods.
		- Running the app with app.Run() to start processing requests.
 

var app = builder.Build();
	- This line builds the WebApplication instance, which represents the configured application


app.Environment.IsDevelopment()
	- This checks if the application is running in the Development environment


app.Run();
	- This starts the application and begins listening for HTTP requests.

<< IServiceCollection >>

	- IServiceCollection: 
		- is an interface in ASP.NET Core used for dependency injection (DI) to register services that will be available throughout the application's lifecycle
