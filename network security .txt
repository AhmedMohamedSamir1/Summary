- any security goals must cover 3 main concepts 
 	1. confendtiality : data must be enctypted before sending from device A to device B and device B will have the key to decrypt the data
 	2. integrity      : data must be protected from any manipulation while it's sent from source to destination
 	3. availability   : keep the data avaialable to the user that has access on it, server is busy which means server can't handle multiple requests
			    

- Network traffic or data traffic is the amount of data moving across a network at a given point of time

- Risk Assessment factors : 
	- Assets :   refer to important devices ,  data , reputation , or anything expose to harm in organization 
	- Vulnerabilities : The presence of weak point that can be exploited by attacker to affect on assets
	- Thread: action exploits the existing vulnerability and tries to make harm to the assets 
	- impact: the result of harm occured due to meeting thread with Vulnerability
	- RISK = Vulnerability * Thread * impact

-Attackers terminologies (types)
	- black hats : (offensive) known as crackers
	
	- white hats : known as ethical attacker, security analyst 
		       attack system to find out the waek points , 
		       using them for defensive purpose , 

	- gray hats  : who work for both offensive and defensive 

what does malicious hacker do ?
	1. reconnaissance : gather information about target organization as much as possible by search on internet
	2. Scanning   : hacker scans the network with specific information gathered during reconnaissance
			like scanning for operating system , open ports 
			
	3. Gaining access : the hacker succedded in hack your system and could expliot your system and launch any attack he want
	4. maintaining access : attacker harden the system from other hackers 
	5. covering tracks    : hacker try to extend his misuse of the system without being detected.


<< attacks >>

attack : is any attemp to destroy , alert, steal or gain unauthorized access to your data , 
attack types:

   - passive attack: attemps to take information from the system and doesn't affect any system resources and its operation like
	using cookies , spyware 
   
   - active attack : change system resources or affect their usual operations like using worms , virus
   
   - social engineering: 
   
   - phishing attack : the hacker create website that looks exactly to popular website 
   
   - insider attack  : 
   
   - Hijacking attack: a hacker takes over a session between you and another individual and disconnects the other individual from the
		     communication, You still believe that you are talking to the original party and may send private
		     information to the hacker by accident.
   
   - SPOOF ATTACK : the hacker modifies the source address of the packets he or she is sending 
   
   - BUFFER OVERFLOW ATTACK: A buffer overflow attack is when the attacker sends more data to an application than is expected.
	 		     A buffer overflow attack usually results in the attacker gaining administrative access 
   
  - password attack : An attacker tries to crack the passwords stored in a network account database 
		       types of password attacks-> dictionary attack, brute force attack, hybrid attack 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- first step of network security : is to divide the one network into parts and 3 important parts are
	- external public network : the internet , we consider it the source of all risks
	- internal private network : the part that i want to protect 
	- demilitarized zone [DMZ]: where organization severs that need to access the internet
 
- divided network is important but is not enough so we need to increase the layers of defense
- defense in depth : means used more layers to secure the network


- if i have a network and its devices connected to same switch which has one single broadcast domain , traffic can cross easily between them and may allow attcker to
  access data illegally and this is a security problem , one of the solution is to divide the network to virtual lans , it's like switch is divded internally to more than switch
  and each virual lan could be exist on more than switch , devices that has the same traffic similarity or communicate repeatedly with each other will be on the same lan
  , each virtual lan consider separated lan , so vlans connects and communicates with each other using inter-vlan-routing
  inter-vlan-routing : give us a chance to check the traffic 

- once attcaker gather info about his target it's an important step to specify the type of attack he will use
- if attacker uses attck that Targets unix vulnerabilities and the target uses microsoft server then the attatck will be not effective, 
  so attacker will perform negative attack (scouting) before attacking to gather the greatest amount of info and determine vulnerabilities about his target 
   to perform an effective attack

- One of the methods used in negative attack is port scanning 
- port scanning allowing info to attacker like
	- provide operting system fingerprinting of target that help him to determing the suitable attack to the target
        - can scan 65,535 ports and check if one of these ports is opened by mistake , if one opened the attacker will target it and convert the negative attack to positive attack
- as a security adminstrator : i will have a permission to make port scannin and discover the vulnerabilities like open ports and close it by firewall berfore attacker exploit it
- there is port scanning softwares that are helpful in port scanning like NMAP and ZENAP


- sniffing : - attcker try to read traffic on the network to get info about network , reading data only is passive attack ,
               if attacker try to change the data called active attack 
	     - as a security adminstrator i have a permission to sniff on make the network to make load analysis, indentidy traffic type, encryption algorithms 
             - software sniffing tools that help in sniffing operation : TCPDUMP , wireshark

- firewall : secure the internal network from any attcks by filtering(check) the input and output traffic
             - firewall can be software on the device -> host based firewall
             - firewall can be a hardware box to filter the traffic at the network level -> network based firewall
             - if the attack is countered before reach the firewall is called -> early neagtion [ high level security ]
	     - if the attack is countered by network based firewall -> negation -> very good security level
	     - if the attack enter private network -> low security [alert] 


- firewall filtering techniques :
	- packet filtering : 
	    - use ACL(access control list) to filter the traffic , ACL is a criteria(rules) by which we determine the allowed and not-allowed IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols
	      firewall check packets and compare its info with ACL criteria
	    - its limitation , it depends on the rules assigned, which may be contradicted

	- stateful inspection : any device sends request packet outside the network to any server it will store info [srcIP, desIP, Dport,...] about it in state table 
		                when the server sends a response the firewall will check if the traffic matches with the info stored in state table
	
	- proxy firewall : - since there is still a danger cause of the ip address of the internal network device is known outside so it may be expoited
			   - firewall uses a nat technique to potect the ip address of network and use another IP address to communicate with internet


- the firewall is important to protect the network but 
  - It may be hacked , by peer to peer aplication like BitTorrent application 
  - Restrictive configuration to needed type of traffic which violates the concept of availability 
 

- bedide security different means there are another means used by companies like 
  - IDS (Intrusion detection system) to monitor the network , make analysis in traffic to detect any atack or any possible attack liek sniffing and port scanning and send alert
  - IPS (intrusion prevention system) : more advanced of IDS detect any atack or any possible attack like sniffing and port scanning and send alert and prevent it	
 
alerts type : 
 1. true  positive  alert  -> true alert , actual attack
 2. false positive alert   -> false alert, no attack 
 3. true  negative  alert  -> no alert   , no attack
 4. false negative alert   -> no alert   , actual attack 
 alert can be sent to scurity adminstrator by email , sms ,

ISP , IPD monitoring methods : 
	- signature based detevtion : examine the traffic , depend on database consists of signatures of known attack ,
	  ids examin the traffic by comparing it signature based and if there is matching IDS send ALERT , 
	  vendor of IDS can recognize new types of signature attack on signature database, update signatures continuously
	  what if there is a new attack signature appeared
	- Anamoly detection : learn the normal traffic signature , by making IDS in learning mode to learn the normal traffic shape and traffic flow of the network
		              so IPS can detect the attackes

- IPS , IDS can be existed in two levels
  1. host based IDS/IPS
  2. network based  IDS/IPS


---------------------------------------------------
<< wireless network >>

- wireless network : data sent openly in this network which make it expose to snaffing by attckers and know sensitive data 
  so we must ensure that data sent is encrypted
- encryption: convert data into sypher text
- decryption: convert data into plain text

Encyption methods :
WEP  (wired equivalant privacy) protocol : the main target of this protocol is to provide encryption to data which is equivalant to wired system 
					 : it use RC4 encryption algorithm , key : 104bits
				         : vulnerabilities-> depend on static key , length of the key 
					 : removed on 2003

WPA1 (wifi protected access) protocol   : more secure than WEP
 			                : it uses RC4 encryption algorithm , PSK(Pre-Shared Key) (changeable-key) , ensure data integrity using TKIP protocol 

WPA2(wired equivalant access) protocol  : strongest level 
					: it use AES encryption algorithm, ensure data integrity using CCMP protocol

wireless threads and attacks like:
  Eavesdropping (sniffing) : attacker sniff on the network , solution is encryt the data 
  Spoofing (masquerading)  : attack try to convince  access point that he allowed to enter the network , solution -> using high authentication protocols
  Denial of service        : prevent authorized users from using the network or any wireless service , solution -> add IDS on your network	 
  Rogue access point       : no password , no encyption 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
   
   
user based threads / attcks
 - social engineering
 - brute force attacks
 - malewares types:
    - spyware :software monitor user activities,  
    - cookies : 	 
    - trojan horse : 	
    - virus : attacked with executable file [ device level ]
    - worm  : like virus but it moves from device to device    [network level]
 - distributed denial of service
