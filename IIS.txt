- Host: Any device on a network with an IP address is considered a host, This can include computers, servers, routers,

- web resources like HTML, CSS, JS, images, JSON, Video and Audio Files:

- Web Application Files (resources): consists of files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, ETC.

- client (like a web browser) makes an HTTP request to a server,and receives responses to display the web application's interface and content.


- Server: The central processing unit that stores data, performs operations, and generates responses to client requests.

- types of servers: web server, DB server, mail server

- web server like IIS, APACHE
	- the central repository of the web application (it hosts your application).          
        
        - When a client needs information or wants to perform an action (like submitting a form), it sends a request to the server. 
          The server processes the request, generates a response, and sends it back to the client.

	- is a software application responsible for storing, processing, and serving Web Application Files to clients
	- generates an HTTP response, which includes web resources with headers containing metadata about the response.
	- a software application responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests from clients and sending back responses.
	

- domain name : ip-adress, port_num
- ip-address  : the identifier of machine, machine has many applications
- port number : the identifier of any application for machine
- any application on a network has port num
- there are 65,535 ports on NIC device 
	- ports : منافذ لدخول وخروج الداتا
	- from 1 to 1023 assigned and controlled by ICANN
	- the default port for web is 80 (HTTP)
- HTTP
   -> a protocol used for transferring web resources over the internet between client and server
   -> web resources like HTML, CSS, JS, images, JSON, Video and Audio Files:


- Request-Response Cycle with Web Server:
    - The client (web browser) sends an HTTP request to the web server,
    - The web server receives the request and determines how to handle it based on the URL and type of request (GET, POST, etc.).
   	- If the request is for a static file (like an HTML,image,CSS),the web server locates the file on its storage and sends it back as the response.
      	- If the request requires processing (such as executing server-side scripts or interacting with databases for dynamic content), 
	  the web server communicates with application logic (like PHP scripts) or database servers which means 
          If the web server identifies that a PHP script needs to be executed, it passes control to the PHP interpreter.



- Localhost: 
  - refers to the local machine itself. When you refer to "localhost" in a web context, you are referring to the computer you are currently using
  - It is commonly used for testing and development purposes when running a web server locally on your machine.
  - The IP address of localhost is usually 127.0.0.1.
  - localhost == 127.0.0.1 refer to local (current) machine
  - 

- "Deployment" 
	- refers to the process of making a software application available for use
  	- in the context of web development, deployment specifically refers to taking the code and files of
  	  a web application from a development environment to a production environment where users can access it over the internet.
	-  Here are some common places where web applications are deployed:
	   Cloud Platforms like AWS, microsoft azure

- Hosting Provider: The company that provides server space and services to host the web application's files and make them accessible over the internet.

- the production environment is where the final version of the software runs and serves its actual users


- your machine consider localhost with more than one server You might have 
	a web server    : Apache , IIS
	appSever        : Node.js
	Database Server : SQL Server


- IIS : 
	- web server(default), can work as FTP server,
	- you can host your websites on IIS
	- handle http request 

- APACHE: 




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- IIS is a features downloaded with windows but it's disabled so if you want to enable it
	go to control panel, program, at program and features (Turn windows featuers on or off), check internet information services


- how to manage IIS
	after you enable IIS from above steps
	on start menu open [ Internet Information Services Manager ]

- localhost is divided into
	- Application Pools : for each web application there is Application Pools object to handle this application
	- sites : websites files

<< host WebApi on IIS >>


 - 

 - make DB works with sql server user -> we will make user on DB 
	right click on logins -> write login name , check sql server Authentication and make password, uncheck enforce password policy 
	at left from select a page choose user mapping and choose database that user will have a permission on it and make him owner from role membership
