- to remove the padding and margin from entire page --> html, body { margin: 0; padding: 0; }

- if you have an element and you want to add "absolute" element above it you can make to the element before and make that before absolute 
  but keep in mind the hover will not work on before and remember the z-index

- the visibility does not affect with transition so you need opacity with it

- if you try making element fixed and its parent has perspective it will not work

- if you keep making left margin until element go to screen left the scroll will not happen but the scroll will happen if you make margin to right

- That tiny upward "jerk" or jump when unhovering is a common side effect when nested hover effects
